It's good practice to store all images in the (./images)[./images] directory.
For now it's easier to store them in this directory. But you might want a division between blog and career images in
this folder.

Images like the [favicon](https://www.google.com/search?q=favicon+explained) should be in the [./images](./images)
directory.
